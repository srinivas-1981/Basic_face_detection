# Basic_face_detection
Basic Face Detection uses computer vision techniques to automatically identify faces in images or video streams.
The concept relies on feature extraction to recognize patterns typical of human faces.
This project uses OpenCV and NumPy for processing tasks and face localization.
A pre-trained model (such as Haar Cascade) scans images for facial patterns.
Detected faces are highlighted, allowing further analysis or real-time applications.
It provides a foundation for more advanced vision systems and face-based technologies.
